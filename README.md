MATLAB (short for Matrix Laboratory) is a programming language and numerical computing environment developed by MathWorks. It is widely used for scientific and engineering computations, data analysis, visualization, and algorithm development.

MATLAB allows users to manipulate and visualize data through an interactive command-line interface or a graphical user interface. It provides built-in functions and toolboxes for a wide range of mathematical and engineering tasks, such as linear algebra, signal processing, image processing, optimization, and control systems.

MATLAB code can be written and executed in the MATLAB Editor or as scripts or functions saved in files. MATLAB also supports the creation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) through its GUIDE tool, which allows users to create interactive programs without writing code.

MATLAB's syntax is similar to that of other programming languages, but its core functionality is based on matrices and arrays, which allow users to perform complex computations on large datasets efficiently.
